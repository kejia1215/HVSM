This is a description of our PPI datasets.

The 'human_data' contains Homo sapiens PPI dataset. The 'yeast_data' contains Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPI dataset. In each directory, there are two datasets. One is 'complete_data' and the other is 'deleted_data'.

The 'complete_data' contains the PPI datasets provided by Jain et al.[23].

The 'deleted_data' contains partial PPI datasets which remove the potentially problematic gene data for IntelliGO.
