This is a description of our PPI datasets.

The 'human_data' contains Homo sapiens PPI dataset. The 'yeast_data' contains Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPI dataset.

The complete PPI datasets are provided by Jain et al.[23].

The deleted PPI datasets are partial PPI datasets which remove the potentially problematic gene data for IntelliGO.
