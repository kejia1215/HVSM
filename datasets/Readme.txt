This is a description of our PPI datasets.

 In the directory of 'ppi',there are two sub directorys namely 'human_data' and 
'yeast_data'. In each sub directory, there are two directorys,one is 'complete_data'
 and the other 'deleted_data'.

The complete PPIs datasets are provided in Jain et al.[23].

The partial PPIs datasets remove the potentially problematic gene data.
