This is a description of our PPI datasets.

 In the directory of 'ppi',there are two sub directorys namely 'human_data' and 
'yeast_data'. In each sub directory, there are two datasets,one is complete PPI
dataset and the other is partial dataset.The partial dataset is in the 'deleted_data' directory.

The complete PPIs dataset is provided in [23].

The partial PPIs dataset removes the potentially problematic gene data.
