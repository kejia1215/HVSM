This is a description of our PPI datasets.

The 'human_data' contains Homo sapiens PPI dataset. The 'yeast_data' contains Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPI dataset. In each directory, there are two subdirectories. One is 'complete_data' and the other is 'deleted_data'.

The 'complete_data' contains the complete PPI datasets provided by Jain et al.[23].

The 'deleted_data' contains the partial PPI datasets in which the potentially problematic gene data were removed from the complete PPI datasets for IntelliGO.
